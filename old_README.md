# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I don't want to waste your time introducing myself. So, the following is a brief summary of what you can find here:

## Current Work

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking the Full Stack Nanodegree on Udacity, you can join me on my journey on [this repository](https://github.com/Anwarvic/Full-Stack-Web-Developer-Nanodegree).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a python package that will be ready very soon insha'Allah.

## Personal Projects

The following repositories are various projects that I worked on earlier. Most of them are super simple:

- [ASR System](https://github.com/Anwarvic/Arabic-Speech-Recognition): A simple Automatic Speech Recognition system for Arabic language using Kaldi and Sphinx.
- [Movie Tweets Search Engine]: A simple ElasticSearch Search Engine indexed using tweets reviewing different English/American movies.
- [Speaker Recognition](https://github.com/Anwarvic/Speaker-Recognition): It's an AI system that can be used for "speaker recognition" or "Speaker Validation" using SideKit package.
- [Tashkeela Model](https://github.com/Anwarvic/Tashkeela-Model): A simple statistical model for diacritizing Arabic text trained on Taskeela corpus, hence the name.
- [Cracking the coding Interview](https://github.com/Anwarvic/Cracking-The-Coding-Interview-Problems): my python solution to most of the problems in the Fourth Edition of the "Cracking the coding Interview" Book. All solutions are in notebooks with some description and unit-tests.
- [Gutenberg Scrapper](https://github.com/Anwarvic/GutenbergScrapper): A simple scraper written in Python for the [Gutenberg Project](https://www.gutenberg.org/).
- [Autocorrection Model](https://github.com/Anwarvic/Autocorrecion-Model): A simple statistical model trained to fix English syntactic errors where the correct word is just two edit-distance away from the wrong word.
- [SemEval2014](https://github.com/Anwarvic/SemEval2014-Competition): My attempt at solving the task B in SemEval competition in 2014. This project needs to be re-organized.


## Incomplete Projects

The following are projects on which I worked earlier, and I couldn't find the time to complete:

- [NeMo Web Interface](https://github.com/Anwarvic/Web-Interface-for-NVIDIA-NeMo): My attempt to create a modern web interface for NeMo.
